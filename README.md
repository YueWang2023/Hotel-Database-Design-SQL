# Project Introduction
In this project, we assumed a business scenario: a local small hotel decided to establish a database to manage their orders and address business questions like When is the hotel's busy season, does the season affect how long people stay at the hotel etc. 

Based on this, we go through the following step:

- Plan, design, and model the data warehouse/ data mart
- Build the data warehouse/ data mart
- Extract, load, and transform data into the data warehouse/data mart
- Prepare tabular and multidimensional analysis on the data warehouse/data mart
- Develop reports and dashboards within the data warehouse/data mart environment
